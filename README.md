<h1>I'm Michael and I'm a Frontend Developer ;)</h1>
Used to be a hospitality enthusiast, but decided to switch into development :)
Frontend suits me more than anything else, due to my experience with web in the past. I used to create websites for several projects, while being in school/university. While some of them were based on constructor sites (like Tilda or Wix), others were performed with HTML and vanilla CSS.
